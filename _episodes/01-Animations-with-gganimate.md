Adding animation to your visualisations is an excellent way to make your work stand out. Human eyes
will naturally focus on movement over a stationary object, so an animation will draw attention. Animations
can also help with the explanatory power of a visualisation, as *changes* in motion are easily detectable.

There are several options for producing animated images in R. We will be introducing the `gganimate`
package here because it is an extension of the ggplot framework you are familiar with. On top of the
grammar of the ggplot system, gganimate adds a grammar of animation that determines how an animation
is constructed.

# gganimate

To create an animation with `gganimate`, we will create a ggplot that consists of several discrete
static positions. The grammar introduced by `gganimate` will allow us to describe how the plot should
transition between these static states.

To understand this visually, it may be easiest to think about a plot where we have facetted by a variable:

ggplot(datasaurus, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap( ~dataset )
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-facets-1.png" title="plot of chunk facets" alt="plot of chunk facets" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Each of these facets represents single state of our data. To animate this, we tell `gganimate` that
we would like to *transition* between these *states* with `transition_states()`. This function needs
the name of the column that defines the separate states of the data we are wanting to animate between.
In other words, the argument we provided to `facet_wrap()`, but without the `~`.


~~~
datasaurus_anim <- ggplot(datasaurus, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_states( dataset )

~~~
{: .language-r}


![]({{page.root}}/fig/datasaurus1.gif)

To produce a pleasing animation, you can specify the relative time spent transitioning between the 
states or showing the states.


~~~
# Three times as long transitioning as displaying the state
datasaurus_anim <- ggplot(datasaurus, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_states(dataset, transition_length = 3, state_length = 1)

datasaurus_anim
~~~
{: .language-r}


|[]({{page.root}}/fig/datasaurus2.gif)

Where it is possible to do so, `gganimate` will transition smoothly between *all* aesthetic properties,
not just x/y position.


~~~
datasaurus_anim <- ggplot(datasaurus, aes(x = x, y = y, size = dataset, colour = dataset)) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_states(dataset, transition_length = 5, state_length = 1) +
  scale_colour_viridis_c()

### Other transitions
`transition_states()` is a the most generic type of transition that can be used, but there are other
alternatives. These will be more appropriate for specific types of data or if a particular transition
is desired.

#### Time
If the states of your animation represent points in time, you can use `transition_time()`. This works
similarly to `transition_states()` except that the length of the transition is proportional to the 
actual time between the states.

This creates an obvious difference just by substituting `transition_time()` for `transition_states()`

~~~
#With transition_states
airqual_anim <- ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Day, y = Temp, colour = factor(Month))) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_states(Day)

airqual_anim
~~~
{: .language-r}


![]({{page.root}}/fig/aq1.gif)


~~~
#With transition_time
airqual_anim <- ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Day, y = Temp, colour = factor(Month))) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_time(Day)

airqual_anim
~~~
{: .language-r}


![]({{page.root}}/fig/aq2.gif)

But becomes even more obvious when your data is not recorded at regular time intervals.


~~~
#Missing data
airqual_missing <- airquality %>% filter(Day <= 10 | Day >= 20)

airqual_anim <- ggplot(airqual_missing, aes(x = Day, y = Temp, colour = factor(Month))) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_states(Day)

airqual_missing <- airquality %>% filter(Day <= 10 | Day >= 20)

airqual_anim <- ggplot(airqual_missing, aes(x = Day, y = Temp, colour = factor(Month))) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_time(Day)

#### Reveal

If you are displaying data in a connected fashion (eg. a line plot), you probably do not think of your
visualisation as having separate *states* to transition between. Instead, you might want to add each 
state to the previous ones, slowly revealing your complete data along a particular dimension. 

In this situation, you can use `transition_reveal()`:


~~~
airqual_anim <- ggplot(airquality, aes(x = Day, y = Temp, colour = factor(Month))) +
  geom_line() +
  transition_reveal(Day)

airqual_anim
~~~
{: .language-r}


![]({{page.root}}/fig/aq5.gif)

Unconnected geometries (such as points), will not be kept by `transition_reveal()`, so can be used 
to mark the current position.


~~~
airqual_anim + geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}


![]({{page.root}}/fig/aq6.gif)



> ## Revealing your data
> To test out `transition_reveal()`, we need a plot containing a `geom_line()` or `geom_path()`. For 
> this exercise, use the following:

>gapminder_lines <- ggplot(
>      data = gapminder, 
>      mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, group = country)

{: .challenge}

#### Layers
The final transition we will look at is `transition_layers()`. This does not transition between 
different states of your data, but treats each layer of your plot as a separate state to be added in.

This transition might be useful if you want to slowly add additional information to a plot:


~~~
iris_plot <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_boxplot(colour = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  stat_summary(colour = "firebrick")

iris_anim <- iris_plot + transition_layers()

iris_anim
~~~
{: .language-r}


![]({{page.root}}/fig/iris1.gif)

By default, `transition_layers()` will keep adding layers on top of each other in the order you applied
them in the code. You have a level of control over how layers are added and removed however, so you 
can choose the comparisons you are wanting to make in the animation.


~~~
iris_plot <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2)) +
  geom_smooth()

iris_anim <- iris_plot + transition_layers()

~~~
iris_anim <- iris_plot + transition_layers(
  from_blank = FALSE,
  keep_layers = c(Inf, 0, 0, 0)
)

# Titles

These transitions provide contextual information through a number of variables that can be included
in the plot labels. The variables are referenced using the [glue](https://glue.tidyverse.org) style,
where the variable name is placed within `{}` and is replaced with its value when the animation is
created.

Each transition provides it's own variables to refer to and these cn be found in the help pages for
the transition. For example, `transition_states()` can use

* **closest_state**: The name of the state closest to this frame
* **next_state**: The name of the next state the animation will be part of
* **previous_state**: The name of the last state the animation was at
* **transitioning**: A boolean indicating whether the frame is part of the transitioning phase

There are a few variables common to all transitions, including 

* **frame**: Gives you the frame index for the current frame
* **nframes**: Gives you the total number of frames in the animation
* **progress**: Gives you the progress of the animation at the current frame


~~~
label_anim <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Petal.Width)) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_states(Species) +
  labs(
    title = "Current species: {closest_state}",
    subtitle = "Next species: {next_state}",
    caption = "Frame {frame} of {nframes} ({progress * 100}%)"
