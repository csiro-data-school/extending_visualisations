### Controlling quality
To gain greater control over how your animation is rendered, use the `animate()` function. This function
is called silently with default parameters whenever a gganimate objected is printed. These defaults 
are designed to trade off animation quality for rendering speed to allow interactive exploration in 
the console. You may want to change these defaults when it comes time to produce a final animation.

Remember this previous animation, where the default parameters didn't produce a nice result

~~~~~
animate(airqual_anim)
~~~~~
{: .language-r}
![]({{page.root}}/fig/aq1.gif)
We can increase the quality of the animation (at the cost of rendering time) but adjusting some of 
the parameters to `animate()`

~~~~~
high_quality <- animate(airqual_anim, nframes = 300, fps = 30, height = 900, width = 1200, res = 300)

high_quality
~~~~~
{: .language-r}

![]({{page.root}}/fig/aq_hq.gif){: .class="fig-responsive" style="max-width:40%;"}

### Saving to file

Once you are happy with your animation, it can be saved out to a file with `anim_save()`. This function
takes the file path to save your animation and the animation itself (or defaults to the last animation
printed, like `ggsave()`).
