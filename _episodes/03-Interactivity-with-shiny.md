Creating interactive web applications provides an alternative way of presenting your data. Rather 
than providing a single, predetermined summary of your data, you can instead provide the tools for 
your end users to investigate your data in their own way. 

The basic tools for producing these apps can be found in the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) package.
These apps can be extended with a little bit of HTML, CSS or JavaScript, but you **can** create a 
fully functional app using only R code.

# Reactivity in Shiny

Creating these interactive applications will involve a pretty large conceptual shift however, because
it 'breaks' the way we have learned R behaves.

> ## Standard behaviour

In a traditional environment, when R creates a variable from an expression it determines the value of
that variable at the time of assignment and stores it. Once stored, the variable loses any connection
to the values were used to create it. So in the example above, once the value of `b` has been set the
value of `a` can be changed without any effect on `b`.

The Shiny framework provides a *reactive* environment, in which inputs and outputs can be linked 
together, allowing them to all update in response to changes. Conceptually, the above example running
in a reactive environment would result in:

~~~~~
a <- 10
b <- a + 5
 
b
~~~~~
{: .language-r}
~~~~~
[1] 15
~~~~~
{: .output}
~~~~~
a <- 20

b
~~~~~
{: .language-r}
~~~~~
[1] 25
~~~~~
{: .output}

The variable `b` now updates its value in response to changes in `a`. Shiny handles the process of 
creating this interactivity in the background, and you can read more about it
[here](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/understanding-reactivity.html). From our perspective however,
changes to one value in our code will appear to flow on to other parts of code that depend on them.

The one limitation that Shiny imposes on our code is that any elements you create within a reactive
environment cannot be accessed by elements in the traditional environment. Since the value of a 
reactive element is not fixed, it is impossible for traditional evaluation to occur. The opposite is 
not true however, reactive elements can access other reactive elements as well as those in the 
traditional environment.

# An app in two halves

When writing a Shiny app, your code will be broken up into two separate parts. 

### User Interface 
The first is the user interface (UI) of the app. This contains all of the inputs that your end user will 
be able to control, and the outputs that they will see. The final result of your UI code is a single
HTML page that can be opened in a web browser.

### Server
The second is the server logic of the app. This is what will run your code in response to user input,
and create the outputs to provide to the user. This part of the code requires an active R session to
function properly, which means you need to find a way to host your app if you want to make it accessible
to other people.

# Creating an app

Shiny comes with a number of inbuilt example applications that can be run from the R console. We'll
explore one of these before we start diving in to creating your own

> ## The end product
> The first example app can be run with:
> ~~~~~
> library(shiny)
> runExample("01_hello")
> ~~~~~
> {: .language-r}
> Explore this basic example and list the reactive, and non-reactive elements you can find. Can you 
> further classify the reactive elements as inputs or outputs?
> 
> You have been interacting with the UI half of the example application. What do you think is 
> happening in the server half?
{: .challenge}

Creating a Shiny app of your own can be done within RStudio by creating a new Project in a fresh 
directory. At the Project Type window, select Shiny Web Application.
![]({{ page.root }}/fig/new_app.png){:class="fig-responsive" style="max-width:50%"}

This creates a skeleton application with the code from the example we just looked at. To run this 
app again, click the Run App button in the top corner of the code editor pane ![]({{page.root}}/fig/run_app.png){:class="fig-responsive" style="display: inline-block; max-height:20px"}.

> > 
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

The functions used in the UI part of the code, just produce the HTML code that makes up the web application.
You can see this for yourself by running some of these functions at the R console. For example:

~~~~~
titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data")
~~~~~
{: .language-r}
~~~~~
<h2>Old Faithful Geyser Data</h2>
~~~~~
{: .output}

or

~~~~~
plotOutput("distPlot")
~~~~~
{: .language-r}
~~~~~
<div id="distPlot" class="shiny-plot-output" style="width: 100% ; height: 400px"></div>
~~~~~
{: .output}

Within the server code, you will mostly see R expressions like you are used to. Two variables are
created (`x` and `bins`) and then a histogram is produced with `hist()`.

> ## Changing things around (optional)
> There are some small differences between the example app you ran initially and your current code.
> To properly recreate the example edit your code to:
> 
> * Change the title of the page to "Hello Shiny!"
> * Change the colour of the histogram from `"darkgrey"` to `"#75AADB"`
> * Add a title to the histogram reading "Histogram of waiting times" (`main` argument of `hist()` function)
> * Add a label to the x axis of the histogram reading "Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)" (`xlab` argument of `hist()` function)
{: .challenge}

# Talking together

The UI and server in an app communicate using the `input` and `output` objects seen in the server code
of the example app. The slider in the UI code is set up with the ID `bins` (`sliderInput("bins", ...)`)
and then the value of the slider is able to be accessed in the server by using `input$bins`. 

Similarly, the histogram that is created is saved as `output$distPlot`. The ID this is saved under
(`distPlot`) is then referenced in the UI when creating a place to display the histogram 
(`plotOutput("distPlot")`). 

You might notice that there is no *explicit* connection made between the input and the output in this
code. Instead, there is an *implicit* connection because the output plot uses the `input$bins` value
in creating the histogram. Shiny keeps track of these 'dependencies' (the histogram plot is dependent
on the `input$bins` value), and reruns code if the dependencies have changed. 

So when the slider is moved, the value of `input$bins` changes. Shiny knows that the `output$distPlot`
is dependent on the `input$bins` value and asks the code that produces the histogram to run again.
While running again the new `input$bins` value is used, creating a different histogram.

### Inputs

So far, we have looked at a single type of input - a slider that changes a single numerical value. In 
the UI code, this slider is created with the `sliderInput()` function:

~~~~~
sliderInput("bins",
  "Number of bins:",
  min = 1,
  max = 50,
  value = 30)
~~~~~
{: .language-r}

The first argument (`"bins"`) is the ID that will be associated with the slider. This ID is how we can
access the value of this slider in our code (through `input$bins`) and so must be unique within your app.

The other arguments determine the label of the slider (the text that is displayed in the UI describing 
what the slider controls) as well as the minimum and maximum values it can take. The `value` argument
determines what the initial value of the slider will be when the app is started.

This same basic structure is used for all the input elements you can create. There will be an input
creation function used in the UI of the form `_____Input("ID", ...)` and the value of that input is
accessible in the server code with `input$ID`. Along with sliders you can create:

* Checkboxes with `checkboxInput()`
* Selections from multiple options with `selectInput()`
* Text entry with `textInput()`
* Numeric input with `numericInput()`
* File uploads with `fileInput()`

and other possibilities that you can see in the [Shiny input gallery](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html).
Some of these input options are just different ways of getting the same result. Try substituting 
the `sliderInput` in your code for `numericInput` for example. The app should still run the same, 
but the way that the number of histogram bins are selected will have changed.

> ## Taking input
> Starting with a minimal Shiny application:
> ~~~~~

>

> ~~~~~

> (`textInput`).
>
> Run your app to check that they are all displaying properly. How would you refer to the *values*
> of these inputs in your server code?
{: .challenge}

### Outputs

To create outputs we will need three components. Like the inputs, there will need to be a UI element
created to display the output. These output elements use the form `_____Output("ID")`, such as in the
example where the UI element to display the histogram is created with `plotOutput("distPlot")`. The
`"ID"` tells Shiny where the server code will be creating the output (`output$ID`), and so again it 
must be unique among output IDs in your app.

The final part of creating an output is to ensure that the output is being produced in a reactive 
environment. Remember that only reactive elements can access other reactive elements. The `input` and
`output` objects Shiny creates are reactive, so without this step our plot would not be able to read
the `input$bins` value from the slider.

Making the output reactive is done by wrapping the histogram plotting code in the `renderPlot()` function.
Each `render____()` function works with a corresponding output type in the UI. So the `renderPlot()`
function creates an outut that can be used in a `plotOutput()`. The `renderPlot()` function takes the 
code to produce a plot as it's first argument and it runs that code in a reactive environment. If
multiple lines of code are needed to produce the plot, they can be wrapped in `{}` to run together.

In the example, this overall structure looked like:

~~~~~
output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
  # Plotting code goes here
})
~~~~~
{: .language-r}

There are different output types you may be interested in creating. The most common ones you are 
likely to need are:

* Showing plots: `renderPlot()`/`plotOutput()`
* Showing data in a table: `renderTable()`/`tableOutput()`
* Showing just text values: `renderText()`/`textOutput()`

Other possibilities can be found by searching the Shiny help files with `??shiny::render`

It might seem odd to just be repeating the input values back as outputs, but printing these values out
to the screen is a technique you may find useful when solving errors in your app.

> * Create an **input** in the UI that can select the year to plot (try a `selectInput()`)
> * Create an **output** in the UI that will display the plot
> * Create the **output** object in the server that will contain the plot
> * Filter the gapminder data by year based on the input value and create a plot
> * Wrap the filtering and plotting code in a `renderPlot()` function and assign it to the output object

### Generic reactives

Sometimes, you will need an intermediate step that is neither an input or output, but is still reactive.
This might be because you want to reduce duplication in code, or because you have a time consuming step
that you need to run and don't want to slow your app down by needing to run it multiple times.

A reactive expression can be created by wrapping lines of code in a call to `reactive()`. To see this 
in action the following lines in the example app:

~~~~~
# Directly link inputs and outputs
output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    x    <- faithful[, 2]
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
})
~~~~~

could have been rewritten as:

~~~~~
# Create a reactive intermediate
reactive_bins <- reactive({
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
    
    bins
})

# Use the reactive intermediate
output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    x    <- faithful[, 2]
    
    hist(x, breaks = reactive_bins(), col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
})
~~~~~

Three points to note in the above example

* The intermediate object is not an input or output, so is just saved as a normal variable name.
* Code running in a `reactive()` function *is* in a reactive environment so can access input values 
like `input$bins`
* The intermediate object `reactive_bins` can be thought of a little like a function, we need to call
it to see it's value. So in the plotting code, this value is referred to as `reactive_bins()`.

The dependency structure of this new code is that `input$bins` is a dependency of `reactive bins`, 
which is a dependency of `output$distPlot`. So when the input slider is moved, the value of `input$bins`
changes, which changes the value of `reactive_bins()`, which changes the histogram.

#### When to use intermediates

One common reason you might need to use a reactive intermediate is if you have some data processing steps
and are then creating multiple plots from the processed data. Rather than running the processing steps
separately for each plot, you might create a reactive intermediate containing the processed data,
then produce plots from that intermediate.

Visually, we are trying to turn a situation like this:
![]({{ page.root }}/fig/duplicated_code.png){:class="fig-responsive" style="max-width:50%"}
into something like this:
![]({{ page.root }}/fig/reactive_intermediate.png){:class="fig-responsive" style="max-width:50%"}

Because the code inside the call to `reactive()` is in a reactive environment, it can access input
values from the `input` object and can be called within `render____()` functions (or other `reactive()`)
functions to have multiple linked intermediate values.

> Extract out the shared filtering step from each plot into a single reactive expression using `reactive()`

# Organising an app

You might be starting to feel like your current `app.R` file is getting a bit large, even though we
have only created a small app. Rather than keeping everything in a single file it is possible to separate
the UI and the server code into two separate files. These files must be in the same folder as each other
and be named `ui.R` and `server.R`.

#### Single file:
~~~~~
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
        ),

        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)

server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
    })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
~~~~~
{:.language-r}


#### Two files

`ui.R`
~~~~~
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
        ),

        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)
~~~~~
{:.language-r}

`server.R`
~~~~~
library(shiny)

server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
    })
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
~~~~~
{:.language-r}

The `ui` and `server` objects must be the final things created in these files, so if you have any 
additional code (eg. loading datasets) it must be placed at the top of the file.
