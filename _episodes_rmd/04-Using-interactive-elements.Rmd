knitr_fig_path("04-")
```

How can I get the most out of interactivity before having to dive in and learn a lot?

##Interactivity for cheap

Use plotly::ggplotly() and renderPlotly()

# Shiny in Rmd docs

runtime: shiny

Don't need all the ui/server infrastructure. Rmd provides the ui, and output$XXXX gets managed for you just using the renderXXXX functions

Still have to give inputs an id and refer to them with input$XXXX



## How to host

shinyapps.io

Shiny.it.csiro.au

DIY?
