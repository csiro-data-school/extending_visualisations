These lessons will require the installation of two new packages on top of those already installed from previous lessons.

For the sessions on animation, you will need the `gganimate` package:

~~~
install.packages("gganimate")
~~~

For the sessions on interactivity, you will need the `shiny` package:

~~~
install.packages("shiny")
~~~
